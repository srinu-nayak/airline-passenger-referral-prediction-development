# Airline Passenger Referral Prediction Development

## Problem Statement
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict whether airline passengers would recommend an airline to their friends. The dataset includes reviews collected between 2016 and 2019, offering a mix of structured and unstructured feedback. The goal is to derive actionable insights and build a robust predictive model.

## Dataset
* **Source**: Airline reviews from Spring 2019, spanning 2016-2019.
* **Features**: Includes multiple-choice responses and free-text comments.
* **Target**: A binary label indicating whether a passenger would refer the airline.

## Features of the Project
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing

* Visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.
* Handling missing values and outliers.
* Encoding categorical variables and feature scaling. 

2. Machine Learning Models
